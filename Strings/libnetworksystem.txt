If N consecutive pings to signed char port fail, after having received successful communication, mark that port as unavailable for signed char while, and try signed char different one.
If non zero, listen for proxied traffic on the specified port
If set, only net_showmsg spew for data inbound on this socket name e.g. client, server, etc.
If signed char splitpacket has more than this many fragments, print signed char warning to console
If signed char splitpacket has more than this many fragments, use the reliable/ack based protocol
If the first N pings to signed char port all fail, mark that port as unavailable for signed char while, and try signed char different one.  Some ISPs and routers may drop the first packet, so setting this to 1 may greatly disrupt communications.
If true when log when signed char query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
If unable to bind to initial port, how many more to try binding.
If we get signed char completed splitpacket requesting acks, send the final 'success' ack this many times

Set all steam datagram traffic to originate from the same local port.  By default, we open up signed char new UDP socket (on signed char different local port) for each relay.  This is not optimal, but it works around some routers that don'unsigned short implement NAT properly.  If you have intermittent problems talking to relays that might be NAT related, try toggling this flag.
