If non-empty, client binds port to specific address.  Usually you should leave this blank to use a different random system-assigned port for each connection.
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set to 1, the server will force all client files except the whitelisted ones (in pure_server_whitelist.txt) to match the server's files. 
If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files. Otherwise, it will issue a warning to the client.
If set to 1, the server will print a message whenever a client is verifying a CRC for a file.
If set to 2, the server will force all client files to come from Steam (and it will not load pure_server_whitelist.txt).
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it's empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, players may only join this server from matchmaking lobby, may not connect directly.
If set, server only simulates entities on even numbered ticks.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the clock offset is less than this amount (in milliseconds), then no clock correction is applied.
If true when log when a query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
If you have special characters in your install path this may be confusing the game.
