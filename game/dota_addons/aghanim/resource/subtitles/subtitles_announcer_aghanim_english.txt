		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_abridged_pt2_01"		"I am Aghanim. Yes, THAT Aghanim. Aghanim the mighty. Aghanim who studied dark, forbidden magic and became lost across the astral dimensions in an effort to create a grand scepter. I'm sure you heard lies of my works in hero school."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_abridged_pt3_01"		"But here is something your stupid teachers DIDN'T tell you: Aghanim has sought out the deadliest creatures from the darkest dimensions and have brought them here to test the mettle of the mightiest among you. Let's begin!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_01"		"Who will it be..."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_02"		"Which heroes have mustered the courage to enter..."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_03"		"Yes... yes..."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_04"		"Who dares be courageous in the face of certain misery?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_05"		"Who's got the gravy to enter Aghamin's deadly realm of mystery?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_hero_select_start_06"		"Who will make Aghamin as proud as a new father?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_weaver_01"		"The scuttler!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_weaver_02"		"Oh good, the giant bug!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_wyvern_01"		"Oh good, a dragon that writes poetry!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_wyvern_02"		"The dragon!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_tusk_01"		"The Northern goon!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_mars_01"		"The war monger!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_witch_01"		"Ah, mister mumbo jumbo..."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_witch_02"		"Ah, a doctor! How prestigious!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_magnus_01"		"He with the horn!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_magnus_02"		"Magnus the Magnificent Magnoluffaguss!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_snapfire_01"		"Hello old girl."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_snapfire_02"		"Beatrix! The TIMES we used to have! Such good times."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_sniper_01"		"The tiny marksman..."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_ursa_01"		"Oh, the fussy bear... delightful!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_ursa_02"		"Ursa the Warrior Bear! Grr!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_viper_01"		"Ooh, the serpenty... flying... green one."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_viper_02"		"It's the green thing! Good stuff!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_omni_01"		"Ah. If it isn't the one they call Purist. Ol' goodie two-shoes himself."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_omni_02"		"Purist! Ha!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pick_omni_03"		"Oh, is he coming too? Well, whatever."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_dawnbreaker_01"		"Dawnbreaker, yeah, OK."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_undying_01"		"Undying, that's great. NOT dying is the whole goal, here."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_luna_01"		"Luna! By Selemane's nose, I knew I could count on you."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_lina_01"		"Lina! Girl, get in here!"

		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_drow_01"		"Drow! Don't you owe me money? Actually, nope-- I owe youuu... we're square, right?"

		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_sand_king_01"		"Scuttle King himself!"

		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_void_spirit_01"		"Void Spirit. Well, I'll take help wherever I can get it."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_queen_of_pain_01"		"Before you become the Queen of Pain are you... the Princess of Pain? Or is there some other honorific? Duchess of Discomfort?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_templar_assassin_01"		"Yes! Templar Assassin. An assassin, a professional killer. A templar, don't know what that is. BUT! We've got a killer on the team, that much I know for sure."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_disruptor_01"		"Whoa whoa whoa, Disruptor, no pets. No pets allowed. And don't say what about Luna that's a service animal. She's working."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_characterselect_slark_01"		"Look who broke out of prison and into my heart! Let's go, Slark!"

		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_01"		"You're back!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_01_02"		"You're back!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_02"		"Welcome back!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_01"		"I knew when I last saw your ripped to shreds, torn limb from limb, bones snapping, tendons twirling that you'd be back!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_05"		"Friend! Hello, friend!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_03"		"Ah! Most wonderful! You've returned!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_04"		"You are persistent. I'll give you that."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_02"		"Aghanim the Lonesome is surrounded by friends once more! Call me Aghanim the no longer lonesome! Wait-- no, Aghanim, the social butterly! Aghanim, the life of the party!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_03"		"Aghanim the Popular welcomes you, his best friend, back. To your doom."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_04"		"Let's begin!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_05"		"Shall we begin? Let me answer that question with the answer... to my question. Let us begin."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_06"		"Familiar monsters from unfamiliar dimensions hungrily await!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_07"		"Strange and dangerous -- yet somewhat familiar -- monsters await!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_08"		"I hope your previous experience did not leave a bad taste in you mouth."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_09"		"Can Agahmin be real for just one moment, and tell you how brave you are for coming back. Are you ready? [clears throat] You are very brave."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_10"		"The rock golems will be most pleased! Wait -- where are the rock golems? [someone off screen tells him] Sleeping? Ugh. Maybe no rock golems today."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_player_return_follow_up_11"		"There are only two ways to leave this cursed place: On your back. Or on your front. It depends on which way you fall when you die."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascension_i_01"		"Look at me, I am a big, strong hero who waddled his way through Aghanim's easiest trial and I return for a zestier offering!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_ii_01"		"This time my menagerie will not be as cuddly."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_ii_02"		"You're back! How brave. How foolish. The word doesn't exist to describe you. Brafool. There."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_iii_01"		"You dare see what deadlier forms emerge from Aghanim's portals? Then step right up and channel yourself a serving of certain death."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_iii_02"		"You're back! Your front! Your arms, LOOK at those lats. But alas, there is something I must reveal. Aghamin the No Days Off ALSO lifts."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_iv_01"		"You have returned! Perhaps you seek a BOLDER challenge? Aghamin the Accomodating makes it so!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_v_01"		"Oh ho! So you seek Aghamin's DEADLIEST challenge? But why? [pause] [laugh] You must be stupid! You are probably stupid. That must be it. I was confused for a second there, but that's it. You're stupid. Good luck, dumb dumb."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_player_return_ascenion_v_02"		"We've sorted the wheat from the chaff and we are left with heroes worthy enough of the deadliest creatures across dimensions. Aghanim the Pleased is pleased. Let's begin."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_choice_select_01"		"Yes! Well chosen! What fun! I do hope your affairs are in order!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_explain_room_choice_02"		"But remember, looks can be deceiving. A vicious appearance could make way for the demeanor of a harmless puppy-dog. But today you should expect that puppy-dog to rip your throats out."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_first_a"		"Lo, mere mortals! It is I -- AGHAMIN! Nemesis of the netherworlds, heretic of the heavens, vile thaumaturge of the -- blahblahblah, you know the thing, worlds best wizard, look, I need your help."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_first_b"		"Before you stands THE CONTINUUM VAULT and in it is trapped a mess of INFERIOR, alternate-reality Aghanims, sprung forth by the fickle machinations of the Continuum Device. We must rescue them, dear heroes!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_first_d"		"So please, fight your way through the Vault and FIND these interlopers! So I can return them to their proper realities!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_return_01"		"Sensational, you've returned to help Aghanim the CONJURER of CHAOS. I'm feeling weak, my heroes. Today I could barely conjure some clutter. Choas is out of the question. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_return_02"		"Ah, my gracious heroes! The Continuum Vault remains riddled with sub-par Aghanims. They await your rescue! But be warned, before you is the same snarl of monsters, goblins and beasts that bested you before. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_return_03"		"The heroes return! Let us waste no time on pleasantries! Get in there and find me an Aghanim. Their very existence drains me of my power! Without it I'm just a man in a ridulous purple robe with STARS on it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_higher_dif_01"		"The heroes return! Yes, The Continuum Vault holds yet more bargain-basement spell-binders. Pursue these Aghanims with zeal despite the vile monsters before you being STRONGER! And FASTER! And with more HIT POINTS!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_higher_dif_02"		"You've returned! The Continuum Vault holds much darker secrets, now. Secrets so murky, so wretched, that Aghanim's sister in law would certainly divulge each one halfway through her first glass of boxed wine at the Aghanim Family Holidays! Oh gosh, is Sheila in there? Make haste and find out!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_higher_dif_03"		"Thank goodness you're here; Aghanim's powers continue to wane. Please, rescue these magical doppelgangers, whose very duplicate existence drains Aghanim's marvelousness away. Return them to me one by one, and I will bend over backwards making sure the dear, dear hearts get home safely. Aghanim doesn't hold grudges. Against these bloodsucking parasites."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_top_difficulty"		"Bless the Astral Plane, you've decided to aid your wizard friend one last time. Let Aghanim be frank -- I... (sheepish) I would have been utterly screwed if it weren't for you all. I need-- AGHANIM actually does really need you. There is but ONE alternate reality Aghanim left.

Believe me when I tell you it pains me to say this. I mean, it really hurts. Look at you. Now look at me. Now look back at you. Do it as quickly as possible, back, forth, back, forth, youll see what I mean. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_01"		"Ooh, they're back!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_02"		"Ah, there they are!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_03"		"Well well well, if it isn't a quartet of benovelent heroes here to save me from myselves. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_05"		"Great! You've all come back. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_06"		"My heroes, do not dawdle! "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_01"		"Perhaps this time, Aghanim the Wise will institute a new rule. Here it is: no dying. At least until you rescue whatever messed up Aghanim is trapped inside of the Continuum Vault. Then, die whenever you feel like it."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_02"		"A foursome of total losers JUST entered the Continuum Vault and were immediately slain. Get in there and fight for Aghanim while the monsters are tired from the skirmish."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_03"		"Let's get down to the skinny of it all: you go in there, you find an Aghanim. That's it. Easy. MAYBE fight some unkillable and ancient evils. Maybe not. You tell me. Well, you will tell me. I'll hear the screams."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_04"		"Good news! You've decided to help me in my quest to eradicate this reality of duplicate Aghanims BUT ALSO, and you may not realize this, by making your way through the Continuum Vault, you're participating in a top-notch weight-loss exercise. I mean, do you know how much your blood weighs??? "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_05"		"So... you think you'll put your lives on the line for ol' Aghanim and get something in return? Something as priceless as my gratittude? Well... that's exactly what you'll get. I really appreciate you."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_follow_up_long_06"		"I... I can't let you all see me like this. My magical powers at an all time low. My confidence at all time low. My lameness at an all time high. It's all highs and lows here. But, I suppose... (poignant) that is but existence as a mortal. (throw up noise) Please, just, get in there and fix this."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_return_addon_01"		"Lets be clear, normally the great Aghamin would never stoop to ask a mere mortals help. Aghamin wouldnt empty his magical bladder on you if you were on fire. But desperate times call for desperate measures from desperate worlds greatest wizards."
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_01"		"Brace yourselves for more!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_02"		"Sharpen your blades! Prepare your incantations! Keep a firm and wide stance!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_03"		"Ah! You'll love these guys. Aghanim has lost his manifest so can't quite remember what or whom you'll be encountering so prepare for the worst! Or the best! Whichever!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_04"		"Through multiple dimensions the most stalwart of enemies I encountered were the thoughts in my own head. Are you prepared to face your own demons? It has little bearing on this next encounter, I'm more just inquiring."
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_05"		"Press on!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_06"		"Knuckle down!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_07"		"Ah, I love these guys."
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_08"		"Here we go!"
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_09"		"Cover your eyes! OPEN YOUR EYES! Peek just enough to see where you're going but then SHUT THEM AT THE SIGHT OF THE BEASTS THAT AWAIT."
		"announcer_aghanim_generic_room_intro_10"		"Once more unto the breach!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_01"		"There are going to be situations where you dont want to kill your enemy; I get it. You dont want to set them on fire or whip an ice spear through their chest -- what a mess. This leaves you in a pickle. What else is there to do? Hmm melt them? CLOSE. Melt their *skeleton*. Melt JUST the skeleton and then youve got your enemy in a little puddle, there. A boneless little pancake. Nobody dies, your enemy is subdued, you carry on your way. Nobody gets hurt."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_01a"		"There are going to be situations where you dont want to kill your enemy; I get it. You dont want to set them on fire or whip an ice spear through their chest -- what a mess. This leaves you in a pickle. What else is there to do? Hmm melt them? CLOSE. Melt their *skeleton*. Melt JUST the skeleton and then youve got your enemy in a little puddle, there. A boneless little meat puddle. Nobody dies, your enemy is subdued, you carry on your way. Nobody gets hurt."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_02"		"OK, here we go! I BELIEVE in you! I mean look at you, you're right there, in the flesh! Seeing is believing! And I definitely believe that you exist! For now!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_03"		"Beware of this enemy's magic! It springs forth foul and wretched, gurgling with thaumaturgy UNSEEN ooooook, I'm going to dial it back. These guys could mess you up, OK?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_04"		"May Aghanim suggest an opening salvo as old as time itself? Good. It's the sucker punch."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_05"		"Hey, if there are any un-melted, somewhat intact skeletons in here can you keep one for me? I'm in the market for skeletons. Not for a spell, just for my den. I think it'd look cool to have one in my corner."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_06a"		"Alright, let's see what you've got!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_06"		"Alright, let's see what you've got!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_07"		"I must say it's a little more enjoyable rooting for you this time around. Aghanim likes an underdog!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_08"		"I'm really relying on you in here. Some might say I'm BETTING on you. Some might say I've taken the over. See, the only thing that could make returning to power more satisfying is getting a little action in along the way."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_09"		"Wait -- before slaying the beasts in this next room, could you MAYBE make it look like you're on the ropes, at least for the first half off the fight? "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_10"		"Allow Aghanim the Self-Actualized to share with you a small, personal observation. I may be avoiding the profound terror I feel of my powers being left to rot in the Continuum Vault. BUT! I've discovered a perfect and harmless distraction: gambling beyond my limits."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_11"		"Let me say, before you guys go in there and eviscerate these creeps beyond recognition, that I'm proud of you. That's it, no snarky rejoinder. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_12"		"This next room? Full of guys that want to kill you. But here's the catch! YOU are going to KILL them FIRST. Boom. VIOLA. No, VOILA. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_13"		"I don't want to be a backseat dungeon slayer BUT if you HAVE any more impressive spells... this might not be a bad time to give them a test run. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_14"		"Alright! Prime your potions! Amp up your axes! Lube your lances!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_15"		"OK everybody, all you heroes, you need to BELIEVE in yourselves. You should BET on yourselves. I'M betting on you! I'm betting WAY TOO MUCH on you. But I've also got a hedge on the Blob Monster and  Possessed Demon Knight."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_15a"		"OK everybody, all you heroes, you need to BELIEVE in yourselves. You should BET on yourselves. I'M betting on you! I'm betting WAY TOO MUCH on you. But I've also got a hedge on the Blob Monster and  Possessed Demon Knight."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_16"		"If Aghanim was at the peak of his powers he'd be right there fighting alongside you... near you... somewhere VERY close by but not in your direct line of sight. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_17"		"Get in there and mess these guys up. I mean it, MESS 'EM UP."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_18"		"Oh, oh, I know a really good spell for these next guys. First question: what are you feelings on eternal damnation? Not necessarily for them, but for you. If you're cool with the edgy stuff, let me know."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_19"		"You know what I like about you heroes? You deal out a real panoply of violence. SPELLS! SWORDS! I saw one of you HIT a guy with a stick! You just never know. Now go stick hit these monsters into next Tuesday."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_20"		"If you get tired in this fight REMEMBER that there is an Aghanim out there who needs you."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_basic_encounter_intro_21"		"Alright, here we go. Now do hero stuff. Hero the crap out of this."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_trap_room_01"		"Be warned, its a trap room! You have to work those traps! Squeeze that core!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_trap_room_02"		"The Continuum Vault seeks to trap you. It's clingy!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_trap_room_03"		"Step lightly, my heroes."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_trap_room_04"		"Tip toe your way to victory, heroes!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_quill_boars_intro_01"		"Quill Boars! A fascinating delicacy. I dined upon specimens not unlike these for what must have been millenia. I couldn't get enough."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_dazzles_intro_01"		"Ah, prepare yourselves for an earthy blend of chakra and chaos magic. Sharp on the nose, nutty in flavor and a bloody finish!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_zealot_scarabs_intro_01"		"It is said that the soul of a scarab scuttles towards the flame of wisdom. Cavort among them! Cavort and scuttle."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_tusk_skeleton_mages_intro_01"		"Defend yourselves! These skeleton mages can summon GRAVESTONES. And on those gravestones are the exact date of YOUR DEATH."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_bombers_intro_01"		"Aghanim's three favorite things include: the dewy grass between his toes on a summer morning, warm foam atop a milky beverage and explosions! This encounter includes ONE of Aghanim's favorite things!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_walruses_intro_01"		"It's hard to imagine that across the infinitude of dimensions that any creature could be endgangered but, alas, these corpulent lads are the last of their kind."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_temple_guardians_intro_01_02"		"These Malorkian Guardians will defend this temple to their death! Or yours! Or until they sell the temple! Or you leave!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_rizz_rick_intro_01"		"Aghanim the Welcoming welcomes you to Forest Hill, made home by the feisty RizzRick who knows nothing but violence."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_storegga_intro_01"		"Let me tell you a short story of Aghanim the Amorous. I've taken many partners in eons of travel, but none was as potent and generous as Storegga. There she was, grinding her granite toes at the shore of a lava-flow. Our eyes met, she hoisted me into the air, and... you can surmise the rest."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_siege_wagons_intro_01"		"You are under siege! Aghamin the Wise and Fair declares it so!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_scored_plains_intro_01"		"I remember my days trapped upon these plains. Both scorched and pre-scorched. What horrors await you here? Aghamin the Enlightened will tell you: SEVERAL horrors!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_chicken_intro_01"		"Don't say a word. You don't have to. Of COURSE you can have a chicken. Aghamin the Generous declares it so!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_chicken_intro_02"		"You may be asking, Aghanim the Generous, from whence across the planes do these marvelous chickens spring forth? Ah, well the answer awaits you in next room."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_roshans_intro_01"		"One breathes fire! One is very small! Who is who?! I dare you to venture a guess!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_rock_golems_intro_01"		"You have faced some of the deadliest monsters Aghanim was able to procure from the farthest, most evil dimensions. But now, Rock Golems."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_leaping_lizards_intro_01"		"You all have earned yourselves a little treasure. Aghanim the Deserving has earned himself the joy of watching you all leap hither and yon atop dragon toads."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_mushroom_mines_intro_01"		"I arrived late to a distant trading post and met a lone vendor whose only interest was in peddling these small mushrooms. Aghanim the Spacious is known to partake in local fixes so I thought, why not?"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_pudge_intro_01"		"This should be sporting!"
		"announcer_aghanim_treasure_room_intro_01"		"Treasure for the stalwart! You've earned it."
		"announcer_aghanim_elite_encounter_intro_01"		"Seriously now, Aghanim has made a big deal out of aquiring the most dangerous monsters for you to face, but much of that was pomp. In this case, however, these are some really bad guys."
		"announcer_aghanim_elite_encounter_intro_02"		"You've chosen one of Aghanim's most DANGEROUS aquisitions."
		"announcer_aghanim_elite_encounter_intro_03"		"Now, this is one of my most dangerous finds. You need to do Aghanim a teensy favor and not let any of the other heroes or monsters know if you survive this, OK? It will just make everyone weird and insecure."
		"announcer_aghanim_elite_encounter_intro_04"		"Now you're asking for trouble."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_void_spirit_01"		"He's thirty feet tall and packed to the gills with magic! You are in for it now."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_walrus_hooks_01"		"They're as fierce as they are fat! And they ARE fat! Do the math."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_01"		"A FIRE MAZE! The hardest maze to solve. Or the easiest to solve with the most burns."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_02"		"ANOTHER fire maze!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_01"		"Before you go in! Remember, this villain is NOT your friend. Sure, does he look friendly? Does he make you want to say hey, haven't we met somewhere before? But listen, hero! Do NOT SAY THAT. I need you to go in there and start firing spells, stabbing, whatever you got. Do not let the Continuum Vault corrupt your mind!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_02"		"Be warned: I've fought this vile conjurer before. Well, I've IMAGINED fighting him before. I imagine fighting everyone the moment I meet them. Then I rank them in a long list of who would be the easiest to fight. Lindsey, the child who walks Aghanim's dog, is at the bottom of the list. And this boss is somewhere near the top."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_03"		"At first I felt a bit guilty, I'll admit, sending you into the Continuum Vault to clean up my mess, but it looks like you heroes are having a heap of fun. I only mention it because beyond this door, I'm pretty sure the fun is going to end. But REMEMBER the fun."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_04"		"OK, OK, listen. You've killed a bunch of monsters. A whole heap of creeps. Now, GOOD NEWS: I think there's only one thing to kill in this room. BAD NEWS: he's about a million times stronger than those wimps you just annhilated. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_05"		"Now, how tough could this possibly be? Anywhere on a scale of one to a hundred, honestly, one being not tough and a hundred being unkillable death machine. It's hard to say."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_06"		"Be careful now. Don't take unnecessary risks. Only necessary risks. Like risk your life to kill this boss if you have to. But don't make me have to do anything."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_07"		"This one looks serious. I don't think it's guarding anything, I'm not even sure if it works here, this one WANTS to fight. Look at it, it's got crazy eyes."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_08"		"I give you... even odds on this one. Probably it'll kill you, but maybe not, let's see how it moves."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_09"		"Remember, this monster is probably more scared of you than you are of it. Unless that's bees. Or bears. I think -- wait. Yes, I remember now, it's definitely not bees. If you see a hive, run, those things are fearless."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_boss_room_10"		"I like your chances of beating this kill-crazy monster. Even though no hero ever has, this thing's unstoppable. But you've got something they didn't have. Me, giving you confidence. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_wyvern_intro_01"		"I've encountered a great number of Wyverns in my travels and, honestly, my first move is seduction. They're magnificent creatures and people tend to just want them for their money. Get to know them. Invest in who they are, not just what they have. That's all of my advice, here."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_explain_room_choice_01_03"		"Now, a choice! You must decide which of the beasts you wish to face."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_quill_boars_success_01"		"Delightfully slain! Did you happen to sample their flesh during combat? Did some of their rich blood splash into your open mouth at the very least?"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_dazzles_success_01"		"Onward!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_zealot_scarabs_bark_01"		"KEEP SCUTTLING!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_zealot_scarabs_success_01"		"Stupendous scuttling, all of you."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_tusk_skeleton_mages_success_01"		"You've survived... but with cursed knowledge of the future. Can continuing on day after day, tormented by the unforgettable, really be considered survival? Don't answer that!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_walruses_success_01"		"You didn't even hesitate to wipe them out! Incredible."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_chicken_success_01"		"Those perfect chickens are from here, right from your own backyard! In fact, this land is the only source of chicken across all the dimensions! I stole them just this morning. From your backyard!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_10"		"Well done! Nothing left alive!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_10_02"		"Well done! Nothing left alive!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_11"		"You have succeeded through bravery and cunning and swords and might and cunning!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_12"		"You have bested Aghanim's champions! Today you have earned something better than riches. My respect. NO RICHES."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_01"		"Well, look at you! Such mighty heroes! Showing off a bit, honestly. Aghamin the Hard Worker... worked VERY hard bringing all these creatures here, you didn't have to kill them all so fast."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_02"		"Hahaha! You are the best! Simply the best!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_03"		"You've done it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_04"		"Success!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_05"		"Masterfully slain!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_06"		"Nobody kills better than you guys!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_07"		"Got 'em all!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_08"		"Bagged it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_success_09"		"Bagged 'em!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_follow_up_01_02"		"Made all the more challenging by... your transfiguration into a simple burro! Prance on all fours through an impossible labrynth! "
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_follow_up_02"		"I have seen dimensions populated solely by pack-animals. Donkeys. Mules. Alpacas. You can pack a raccoon with enough patience."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_storegga_success_01"		"I see you have satiated her ample appetite. Gather your treasures and press on!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_i_01"		"Such mightily strong and courageously brave heroes! Showing off a bit, really. Aghamin worked... very hard to assemble this vast menagerie, and you're just... whipping through them. I mean, learn their names or something."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_i_02"		"My my, you've killed the first of my most blood-thirsty finds. Aghanim didn't quite expect that... but, of course, Aghanim expects everything so I expected not to expect it. As you'd expect. Onward!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_i_03"		"Ah! You must feel so accomplished standing there in a pool of vanquished blood! Don't you worry, Aghanim has even more beasts full of blood for your vanquishing."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_i_04"		"That was but the first of Aghanim's most prized discoveries. Well done and hurry forth."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_i_05"		"I'll bet you feel PRETTY good about yourself standing there in that pool of Aghamin's monster blood like Mr. Brave Boots. But are those brave boots waterproof, Aghamin wonders? I doubt it very much! [laughs] Enjoy shopping for NEW BOOTS!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_ii_01"		"So you've slain the second of Aghanim's most powerful monsters. The third will not fall so easily."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_ii_02"		"Aghanim is very impressed with your strength. The Temple Guardians are impressed, the Rock Golems, we're all very impressed. So if you would allow the remaining beasts to feel like they have a chance, we would be most gracious."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_ii_04"		"Teamwork, bravery, perserverance -- it's all on display! Perhaps the Rock Golems can learn something from you humble warriors. Hurry forth!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_01"		"Stab them lest you be stabbed!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_01_a"		"Keep stabbing!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_02"		"Zap them lest you be zapped!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_02_b"		"Keep zapping!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_03"		"End them with MAGIC! Or STRENGTH or AGILITY[?] I GUESS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_04"		"Hiiiii---ya!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_05"		"Not how Aghanim would handle these guys but the effort is inspiring!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_06"		"Just use your powerful spell!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_07"		"Get em!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_08"		"THUMPED em!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_09"		"Great guns!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_10"		"Gah! I cant look!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_11"		"Yes! Yes!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_13"		"Ah, I SEE how this could be difficult for the omnipotentally challenged."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_14"		"Just melt their skeletons."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_14a"		"MELT THEIR SKELETONS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_14b"		"Why do these guys still have skeletons?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_14c"		"Have you THOUGHT about using a disappearing skeletons curse?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_15"		"I think one of you has a fireball spell. Use that until they're all dead."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_16"		"Did you just hit that monster with your actual ARMS? You actually TOUCHED it?! You are WILD."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_17"		"If they have eyes, poke the eyes. If they don't have eyes, fish hook the mouth. If they don't have eyes or mouths how hard can this fight really be?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_18"		"Now, boys, boys no need to fight. But if you WANT to fight, as it seems you do, you should."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_19"		"Good, good! SURPRISINGLY good!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_20"		"You're doing... well! I'm impressed! And surprised! Mostly surprised!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_21"		"[chuckling] Look who's crushing it down there! "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_22"		"Doing well! Doing VERY well, in fact! I'll just say it: I am doing INCREDIBLY well at encouraging you!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_23"		"Amazing! Jaw-droppingly amazing! If you were trying to describe my ability to encourage heroes, those are the words you'd use!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_24"		"Gorgon's tail, you're killing it down there!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_25"		"Mephistopheles' horns, look at you go!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_26"		"Hit it! No, the other one! Okay good, keep hitting it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_27"		"You're doing great! Try kicking it! You're not kicking it. Try kick-- you're ignoring some firstrate advice here. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_28"		"Oh my GOD! This is carnage!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_29"		"That -- that can't even be legal, what you just did to that poor creature."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_30"		"THAT was pretty sick."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_31"		"Okay, good! Now hit THAT one! Good! Now hit THAT one! Hahaha! We make a great team!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_32"		"Look at you go! Look at me look at you go! We're both great!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_33"		"This is hot stuff!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_34"		"That is some hot chili you're serving up down there."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_35"		"Your fists are a BLUR!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_36"		"Do you know any spells? Any good ones, I mean."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_37"		"You're a DOG! You're a MAD DOG! Hahaha, you lunatic."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_38"		"I think you just broke that one's arm. Ohp, nevermind, it's dead."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_40"		"WHOA! Retreat! Retreat! (Did they buy it? Wait for them to drop their guard and then MESS them UP.)"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_02"		"I don't see why they let this thing run a nether dimension, it doesn't seem so tough. That's bad hiring."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_03"		"I was watching this thing you're fighting spar earlier. It's got good reflexes, really positive attitude. It came to win, I like its chances."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_04"		"I can't tell if you're winning, this is just a... just a hot mess of spells and hitting."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_05"		"I can't figure out what's happening. Are you winning? There's too much going on at once."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_06"		"Are you winning? You're winning, aren't you? Should I bet more? I can call my bookie, hit the monster twice if you think I should bet more!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_07"		"You can do it! Beat these stupid heroes! I believe in you! [whispered] Don't worry, I'm still on your side. I'm trying to get in its head! [big] These heroes are so weak and soft! Look at how soft and weak and soft they are! [whispered] You're very strong!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_encourage_08"		"I'm so confident you're going to beat this guy, I just put a new mortgage on my realm and used the proceeds to bet on this fight. Although, Aghanim should note your enemy is the underdog in this fight, so.... maybe take a fall? Forget I said anything, forget I said anything!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_01"		"Hahaha! I can't believe you guys! Ohhhh, I am PUMPED here!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_02"		"Ha ha ha! Yes! What's my name? What! Is! My! Name! You guys did good too."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_03"		"We make a great team! Your brawn! My brains! And my strategy, and my communication and patience and interpersonal skills! Most of the heavy lifting on my end, 80/20, but GO TEAM!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_04"		"Good work! By me, being smart enough to bet big on you winning! You were a HEAVY underdog at the Dark Elf casino. A CERTAIN mighty sorceror named Aghanim might be buying a new pool this year."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_05"		"Nice work down there! Good killing, very brutal and efficient! Honestly, if I was in the room with you right now I'd be frightened, you're terrifyingly precise at murder."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_06"		"That boss was so much bigger than you but you killed it  anyway! My goodness. Hmm. Maybe it had some sort of microphobia and he was just terrified of you from the start. That's sort of sad, this hulking beast, terrified, fighting for its life. Oh well!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_07"		"There you GO! Really feeling yourselves, now. Great work!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_08"		"Yes! Did you see that, everybody?! Those are my heroes! Those are my babies!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_09"		"Great work! But don't relish it for too long, remember, you're only as great as the last magnificent being that you've killed!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_boss_success_10"		"That is THE stuff. Let's keep this going, everybody!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_01"		"Aghanim KNEW youd come through for him."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_01a"		"If you keep killing like that well have these doppelgangers rescued in no time."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_02"		"Ill be honest, Aghanim and his Trust Issues were sweating that one. Well done!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_03"		"Ah look at you! Give a little flex for Aghanim! Lets see those guns. Oohh hmm youre more the cardio, reps not weight, lean over bulk type, then. NO mind! Hurry forth with that fabulously low heart-rate!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_04"		"There we go! There *I* go! Away from this terrible place in the not too distant future!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_05"		"One step closer to Aghanim no longer needing you! I mean, you and your help! I'm going to let you go."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_06"		"Making quick work of the Continuum Vault! "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_07"		"OK, I was pretty sure you were going to die back there so I've already called up another group of heroes. If you come across them, I promise you, they mean nothing to me. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_08"		"If I had children I'd want them to be just like you guys. OK, I *do* have children. (to self, mournful) Dear GOD, do I have children. So many children. So... so... anyway, I wish you were them. There. I said it. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_09"		"From the omniquartz roads of Maldrune to the depths of Dark Reef I've never seen such wickedness! I like it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_10"		"That was stupendous! Even from the one with the weird lump on his back! If you survive the rest of this, have that checked out!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_11"		"One step closer to one of these flimsy clones! Bless your souls."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_12"		"Whoever is in charge of mopping up the blood in the Continuum Vault REALLY has his work cut out for him."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_13"		"True savagery."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_14"		"It really feels like you're all punching above your weight, here. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_generic_15"		"Thank the stars for whatever you're compensating for with all of this bloodthirst. Carry on!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_12"		"You know you can cast a plume of infernal hell fire that will insta-kill everything inside of the Continuum Vault, right? Get all of these Aghanims back and I'll show you. You don't have to go through all of this."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_fight_encourage_39"		"I like your moves. I like your style. I think you and your family should come to my house some weekend for a barbecue."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_rock_golems_outro_01"		"Aghanim was unfair to the Rock Golems before. They ask that I assure you that they are normally VERY DANGEROUS."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_leaping_lizards_outro_01"		"Wonderful leaping!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_mushroom_mines_outro_02"		"Well played! But have your eyes gone cross? Are you gripped by the ethereal phantoms?"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_pudge_outro_01"		"Aghanim gazes upon those who have butchered the butcher! Onward!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_walrus_hooks_02"		"They're fierce! They're fat! That's everything!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_walrus_hooks_01"		"You did the math! Onward!"
		"announcer_aghanim_treasure_room_outro_01"		"Now, gold cannot buy happiness. But it can buy goods and services which can MASQUERADE as happiness, which Aghanim argues is just as good."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pre_aghs_room_01"		"Aghamin works his wizard fingers to the bone capturing majestic beasts for YEARS just so they can kill you -- ONCE! -- and you can't even spare a minute to let them kill you. Well, you know the old saying: If you want something done right, do it yourself."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pre_aghs_room_02"		"Well, fine. Never send an Aghamin's Monster to do an Aghamin's job. You want a REAL challenge? You got it. Here comes Aghamin the Interdimensional Mage King! And I'm not afraid to say it: I'm MAD! And STRONG. And I know magic! I'm not really mad, I've been looking forward to this."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pre_aghs_room_03"		"I just did a hundred push-ups, hero, and I am pumped. Also tired, all of my blood is in my arm muscles, I feel like I'm going to pass out. Luckily I don't NEED my arms to cast magic at you. Most of my spells do not require them! I'm sorting through them now!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pre_aghs_room_04"		"Have I mentioned who your final challenge is? Because he's very famous! Do you have an autograph book? Is it covered in your own blood? Because it soon will be!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_story_time_1_01"		"You may be wondering why Aghanim was traveling across dimensions to begin with. The story, not unlike some of you, is short and embarrassing."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_story_time_2_01"		"On your path to Grand Magus you are taught many things, none of which is as important as this: NEVER under any circumstances TRANSPOSE THYSELF across DIMENSIONS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_story_time_3_01"		"But how does one craft a scepter of infinite power? By TRANSPOSING THYSELF ACROSS DIMENSIONS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_story_time_4_01"		"I was lost among the mists of creation, UNTIL -- I heard a tiny voice reciting my words across the din of time."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_story_time_5_01"		"It was you. And you, and you, and you! Calling me back, creating your quaint versions of Aghanim's Scepter. So, thank you, friends. Without your little incantations, I'd still be twisting through time and space."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_weaver_01"		"Weaver chooses wisely."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_weaver_02"		"The Scuttler grows more capable of scuttling."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_wyvern_01"		"Bestowed, Wyvern!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_wyvern_02"		"Very good, Wyvern!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_mars_01"		"Flex your might, Mars!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_mars_02"		"My word, Mars!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_sniper_01"		"Take aim, Sniper."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_sniper_02"		"Sniper's eyes grow more keen."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_viper_01"		"That's the talent you'd like, Viper? Wow."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_viper_02"		"Viper, you're a snake with... wings? Is that right?"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_omniknight_01"		"Mr. Goodie Goodie grows goodier!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_omniknight_02"		"Well chosen, Omni."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_tusk_01"		"Tusk punches up!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_tusk_02"		"Tusk grows stronger!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_witch_doctor_01"		"Look at you go, Witch Doctor!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_witch_doctor_02"		"Ah, good choice, witch. Dr. Witch."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_ursa_01"		"The bears claws grow sharper!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_ursa_02"		"Cute choice by the cuddly bear."
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_snapfire_01"		"That's right, granny!"
		"announcer_aghanim_ability_select_snapfire_02"		"Bestowed, Beatrix."
		"announcer_aghanim_first_temple_guardian_dies_01"		"Uh oh, now you've done it!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_attack_not_in_room_01"		"Coward! Cowards! Face them in the arena!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_attack_not_in_room_02"		"An act of cowardice! I would expect this from Omniknight!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_attack_not_in_room_03"		"An act of cowardice! Typical of Omniknight!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_attack_not_in_room_04"		"I did not bring monsters across dimensions to face such recreants!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_attack_not_in_room_05"		"BOCK BOCK BOCK! That is what you sound like!"

		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_team_wipe_06"		"Nooooooooo! Oh well."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_team_wipe_07"		"OK, you can get up now. Playing a little possum is a fun strategy... you're selling it. Annnnny minute now..."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_team_wipe_08"		"You've all died. Unbelievable. Well, totally believable. Probable, in fact."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_01"		"What a fun twist of fate for us all. Last time, Aghanim helped you become stronger, wiser heroes by murdering you over and over again AND this go around youre helping Aghanim become stronger and wiser by being murdered over and over again."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_02"		"Ahh, gosh. Really needed you guys to come through for me, here. I guess my only option is to learn to live with being mediocre at best. Maybe I'll get into the guitar. Pick up some gigs at a farmer's market. Nothing serious. Yeah, that sounds OK."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_03"		"Alright! You're all dead. No big deal -- I got another batch of heroes here so I'll tell them about all ways you failed so they don't do the same. See? Chin up! No, would someone actually pick this guy's severed chin up off the ground?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_04"		"Aghanim put too much pressure on you, didn't he? This always happens. I meet a nice bunch of heroes, we move a little fast, we're getting along like a house on fire, I get my hopes up, and then nothing. No warning, no call, not even a text. I will sit around all day thinking maybe their mom is sick or maybe they all died in a reality bending dungeon. I don't think you realize just how cruel that is."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_05"		"OK, so you're all dead. This Continuum Vault is a real meat grinder, huh? Hmm, does the Continuum Device grind meat? Is that in the manual? Hrrrrm... [flipping through] it makes no sense that they put these things in so many languages. How do you say meat grinder in French? Ah. Here it is. Ha-Schwarr ah vee-onde. Nice, nice."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_06"		"Youre all dead? I thought you were heroes! How did you get into hero school? Were your parents alumni or something? Did you even graduate?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_07"		"Wait, youre all dead? Youre kidding me. I barely took my eyes off you for a minute, how is that even possible? Did you all have simultaneous heart attacks?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_08"		"You had one job: Dont all die. Technically it was a job sharing situation. So you didnt even HAVE one whole job. You had PART of a job."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_09"		"Are you all dead? Well, thats just great. I wish Id never become a Sorcerer. Do you hear that? You're so bad at this you ruined my dream job."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_10"		"Worry not! For as long as one of you still lives, the pure good light of the true and stalwart hero will are you ALL dead? You're kidding me."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_11"		"Don't worry! We're not dead yet! Put some hustle in it and let's -- what's that? Oh. No, you ARE all dead. Alright, forget what I said about the hustle. Not... gonna... need... THAT."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_12"		"Alright, you know what they say, death is just a doorway, and God doesn't close a door without opening a window, so just climb out the window and -- I don't know, whatever housing metaphor will get you moving again. Find the stairs into the... victory attic."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_13"		"You cant ALL be dead. What happened to the little fat guy? Whered he go? I swear you guys had a little fat guy, or a chubby kid, or -- he threw swords. Or made sand clouds, or -- look, the point is hes not in your body pile, so I think were still in the game here! Go Fatty Sand Clouds!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh2_team_wipe_14"		"OK, so reality isn't going to get sorted out and I'm not going to be returned to power and I'm not going to tie up some very important business. That's fine. No big deal. [Beat] Do you know what the Dark Elf casino does to a powerful sorcerer when that sorcerer owes them a lot of money? They send Brandon. Which doesnt sound intimidating, I grant you, but he... is ENORMOUS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_01"		"Well, he killed you. But on the bright side, he didn't kill me. Because I'm not there. Silver linings."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_02"		"Are you all dead? You're all dead, aren't you?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_03"		"The thing about ancient evils is that they don't just become ancient overnight. Killing groups of heroes is probably pretty old-hat for him, honestly."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_04"		"Ahhhh we we're SO close Aghanim's power is waning I feel the emptiness growing, I really needed this. I understand that laying a guilt-trip on a pile of dead bodies is pointless but, oof, really thought we were going to get this done today."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_05"		"This is not a big deal. I want you to know it's OK. I mean, Aghanim is destined to an enternity of fecklessness BUT don't let that be a thing. You tried your best. This is what we call a guilt-trip sandwich, which is related to the compliment sandwich and the put-down gyro. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_06"		"OK. You're all dead. Aghanim should've prepared himself for this eventuality.  It was a primal force of ancient evil, after all. That's on me."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_07"		"He IS pretty good at killing, isn't he? I mean, I know you're all dead, yes it's tragic, but still! It's actually kind of impressive, that was like four on one and he cut through you like warm butter!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_team_wipe_pb_08"		"I wasn't paying attention, did you win? What happened? Oh boy."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_intro_01"		"Welcome to Aghanim the Timely's Gauntlet of Efficiency!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_intro_follow_up_01"		"You've killed before, you'll kill again, but this time you've gotta go fast."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_intro_follow_up_02"		"It's a time trial! That's right, we're putting time on trial, get moving! Time, take the stand!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_intro_follow_up_03"		"It's a time trial! Go! I'm not even going to waste time explaining it! You're on the clock! Go!!!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_first_boss_bad_01"		"Well slain! There are only--- whoa, there's a lot of parties ahead of you. Pay no mind! Hurry forth!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_first_boss_good_01"		"Wow! You guy -- you diverse collection of entities are making great time! Go, go go go! No time for compliments!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_first_boss_neut_01"		"Aghanim the Supportive would like to tell you that you're not the fastest, but you're also not the slowest, you're comfortably nestled within the bosom of the herd. Now get going!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_team_wipe_01"		"You're all dead. Allow Agahnim the Bereaved to warn you of the dangers of going TOO fast."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_team_wipe_02"		"Akin to Icarus you flew too fast. That's right. Just like Icarus, you flew too fast."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_team_wipe_03"		"Oh no. Oh my goodness. I said Go! Go fast! Go go go! and now look what happened. I am Aghanim the At Fault."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_team_wipe_04"		"Oh no. This is-- I said Go! Go! Go! and now you're all dead. I am Aghanim The Bereaved but Not Technically Legally Liable for this. So, condoloences. And that's it."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_team_wipe_follow_up_01"		"I admit nothing but my sadness that you're gone."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_hero_death_01"		"That's going to slow you down!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_hero_death_02"		"Oh no! You are the sole survivor!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_hero_death_03"		"Leave the slain! There is no time!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_hero_death_04"		"A hero has died! Spare no time in shedding tears!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_hero_death_05"		"A member of your party has perished! Keep fighting!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_room_choice_elite_01"		"Oh! The deadliest challenge! Impressive!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_room_choice_elite_02"		"The clock ticks and you've chosen certain death! No cowards here!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_timetrial_room_choice_elite_03"		"The hubris! The temerity! Agahnim is impressed by the audacity of your stupidity!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_01"		"Uh oh, looks like this guy wants to make you some sort of *deal.*"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_02"		"Beware these shadowy negotiators! Unless they're offering you free money, just take the money."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_04"		"See what they've got."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_05"		"Hey-- oh, hey-- just *casually* ask if they've seen or heard of any primal forces of ancient evil rattling around in here. You want to slide it into conversation, don't underscore it. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_06"		"No bad choices here! WAIT--... no bad choices here!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_07"		"Ooh, see what's being offered and then take it immediately. That's my motto."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_08"		"Check out the hustle on this fella! "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_09"		"Look! A small business owner!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_10"		"I wonder what they're offering."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_11"		"It's someone you don't have to kill! That's new and fun!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_oneaghleft_01"		"Ah, heroes, we are close to our goal! I feel there is but one left. One terrible, soon to be incineraaaave...saved Aghanim left."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_doom_01"		"Oh-OH... gonna shut up for a second. (ducking out) If Doom is all hey, are you in contact with Aghanim these days? I'd say... nah man, nah. Yeah, just throw it away like that. Or whatever, the answer is just no, trust me."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_small_tiny_01"		"Hey! Look at this little fella. Whatever he wants, just give it to him."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_big_tiny_01"		"Listen, I have some personal baggage with rock monsters so you should do whatever you want here. I'm biased. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_brewmaster_01"		"I too fancy the buzz of a mind altering brew."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_oracle_01"		"First thing's first: this fella? Don't trust him. Never trusted him. Remember, you work for me."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_naga_siren_01"		"Bottle it up!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_naga_siren_02"		"Great, OK, a Naga Siren. Fair warning: they go on and on and on about karaoke. It's a thing."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_morphling_01"		"There's nothing he can offer you that I can't. (Inspecting) Hmm... no, no, there's no way I can do any of that. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_alchemest_01"		"Remember: one man's trash is another man's overpriced mistake."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_ogre_magi_01"		"Oh, oh, oh! I know this guy. Do your thing but can you see if he's still taking odds on the Prowler fight. He'll know the one."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_slark_event_01"		"Remember: money can buy happiness. It absolutely, 100%, can buy you happiness. Anyone who says otherwise is lying."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_warlock_01"		"I know we wizards have a competitive streak, we all really hate each other, but allow Aghanim to let you in on a little secret. The Dark Arts guys? I love 'em. They're unhinged. Step on their robes? ZAP, your whole family turns to imps. Just... nuts, right?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_zeues_01"		"Oof, just get in and get out with this guy. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_bear_lair_intro_01"		"Oh-- heroes! This one's easy. You play dead -- that's definitely what you do when faced with a bear. Put on your best performance. Really commit. If he starts chewing on you and you feel yourself dying... well, that's called method acting. Pull back, don't lose yourself to the character."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_salty_shore_intro_01"		"Nobody likes gulls and you guys definitely are NOT going to like these gulls. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_blobs_intro_01"		"While the Continuum Vault holds monsters from all sorts of realities, you're lucky that it seems devoid of any poisonous blobs. They are just the worrrr--- OK, hold on, maybe these blobs aren't POISONOUS.  "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_swamp_intro_01"		"If I coud wield the great scepter of Aghanim I would shazam creepy crawly monsters like this RIGHT OUT of existence."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_eggs_intro_01"		"Heroes! Protect the eggs!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_polarity_intro_01"		"The mysteries of the Continuum Vault grow... bluer. Or redder. Honestly, I find auras devisive. I know thy Grand Scepter bestows one upon the holder but I never signed off on that."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_demonic_woods_01"		"There are DEMONIC WOODS? GAH, come on! You know what I would GIVE to be trapsing arounds some demonic woods, my robes shimmering and thrumming with primeval wizadry?! A LOT."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_naked_axes_01"		"The Continuum Vault takes something from us all. In this case, these little men's clothes."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_03"		"A JUNGLE fire maze! The hardest maze to solve! Or the easiest to solve with the most burns! "
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_01"		"You're here! Magnificent! I suppose you're wondering why I've invited you here by capturing you."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_02"		"I am Aghanim. Yes, THAT Aghanim. Aghanim the mighty. The Aghanim who studied dark, forbidden magic and became lost across the astral dimensions in an effort to create a grand scepter. I'm sure you heard lies of my works in hero school."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_03"		"But here is something your stupid teachers DIDN'T tell you. I didn't spend half an eternity wandering multiple dimensions feeling SORRY for myself. No. Instead, I sought out the deadliest creatures from the darkest dimensions, hoping to one day bring them here to test the mettle of the mightiest heroes of the realm. That day is TODAY! Let's begin!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_01_02"		"You've come! Excellent. I must apologize for smashing all of your scepters to bits. I found myself most invigorated upon my return and let that vigor get the best of me."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_02_02"		"I've been lost beyond the astral plane, moving hither and yon between dimensions for countless lifetimes. My mind is as warped as my sense of time."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_intro_03_02"		"But for now I am among friends. And friends, I'd love to share with you some of the wonders to be found across dimensions. Beasts to inspire fear, wonder, nausea, and death. Just great stuff. However! You are all mighty warriors, in your own way. I doubt you will die over and over and over again. Hurry forth!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_mystery_encounter_01"		"Mystery Encounter!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_mystery_encounter_02"		"Mystery Encounter!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_choice_mystery_encounter_03"		"An encounter of mystery!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghs_mushroom_mines_intro_02"		"[ALT] Across dimensions, encountering a funghi means one of two things: hallucinations or death."
		"announcer_aghanim_choose_difficulty_01"		"Ha!"

		"announcer_aghanim_choose_difficulty_03"		"Ooh! Hahaha!"
		"announcer_aghanim_choose_difficulty_04"		"HAHAHAHAH!!!"
		"announcer_aghanim_choose_difficulty_05"		"BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!! LET'S DO THIS."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_progress_act_ii_03"		"I knew as you made your ingress into Aghanim's chambers that you were no slouches. The question remains, however, will you be capable of your egress? I promise you the your exit is marked and unobstructed, as when Aghanim is not hosting fights to the death he is a stickler for safety."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_temple_guardians_intro_01"		"These Malorkian Guardians will defend this temple to their death! Or yours! Or until they sell the temple! Or you leave!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_morphlings_intro_01"		"Upon wandering lost across countless dimensions, I return to you having learned at least one principle fact of creation: something common, such as your friend Morphling, can be made cute simply by making it small. Dote on these adorable creatures and then smash them to bits."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_morphlings_intro_01_02"		"Upon wandering lost across countless dimensions, I return to you having learned at least one principle fact of creation: something common, such as your friend Morphling, can be made cute simply by making it small. Dote on these adorable creatures and then smash them to bits."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_morphlings_intro_01_03"		"Upon wandering lost across countless dimensions, I return to you having learned at least one principle fact of creation: something common, such as your friend Morphling, can be made cute simply by making it small. Dote on these adorable creatures and then smash them to bits."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_01"		"Wonderful choice!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_01_02"		"Wonderful choice!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_02"		"Excellent!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_03"		"Gasp! That one. Hmm."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_03_02"		"Gasp! That one. Hmm."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_04"		"Bestowed!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_05"		"Yikes!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_06"		"Here comes trouble!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_06_02"		"Here comes trouble!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_07"		"Flex your might!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_07_02"		"Flex your might!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_08"		"Very good!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_ability_select_09"		"My word!"
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_explain_room_choice_01"		"Now, a choice! You must decide which of the beasts you wish to face, sight unseen."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_explain_room_choice_01_02"		"Now, a choice! You must decide which of the beasts you wish to face."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_fire_maze_follow_up_01"		"Made all the more challenging by... your transfiguration into a simple burro! Prance on all fours through an impossible labrynth! "
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_temple_arena_intro_01"		"Lo! The temple arena! Here you will find the deadliest monsters Aghamin was able to procure from the farthest, most evil dimensions. And also rock golems. Aghamin the Jokester kids about the rock golems, they're pretty deadly too."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_temple_arena_success_01"		"Aghanim was unfair to the rock golems earlier. They ask that I assure you that they are very dangerous."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_explain_room_choice_02_02"		"But remember, looks can be deceiving. A vicious appearance could make way for the demeanor of a harmless puppy-dog. But today you should expect that puppy-dog to rip your throats out."
		"announcer_aghanim_aghanim_room_choice_select_01_02"		"Yes! Well chosen! What fun! I do hope your affairs are in order!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_reveal_01"		"Oh crap, it's the primal beast I was telling you about. Alright, nothing to worry about. He's honestly only got the one trick he does, it's -- I mean, it's one hundred percent effective, he's going to kill you, probably. But -- well, let's get some hustle down there. Go team!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_reveal_02"		"Oh crap, it's the primal force of ancient evil, the primal beast, I was telling you about. Alright, don't panic. Honestly, he's only got like ONE move. It's super basic, easily avoidable, and one hundred percent effective, unfortunately. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_reveal_03"		"OH no. There is he is. OK, on the plus side, I knew he was going to be here. I was sure of it. Also on the plus side, I didn't tell you I was sure of it because I didn't want to stress you all out. So, no downsides from Aghanim, here. ALSO, how often do you get to fight one of the most ruthless beings ever known?  What I'm saying to you is, this is all upside. You're lucky, actually."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_reveal_04"		"Now, heroes, all you have to do is fight your way through ONE -- just ONE -- primal force of ancient evil and you'll have helped dear Aghanim in his quest. ONE! That's half of two! God, there better not be two. No, no, there's no way there are two. They'd have killed everything in existence by now if there were two."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_return_01"		"Okay, this time you'll probably kill the primal beast. And even if you don't, look on the bright side: I'll still be alive. I'm very safe here. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_return_02"		"I don't want to put any pressure on you but... (big melodramatic cough)... if I don't make it, I want you to promise me you'll kill this primal beast and rescue whichever Agahnim he's got. Do it for Aghanim. Best friend Real Aghanim who's dying."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_return_03"		"And we're back! I like your chances here. You saw how this beast killed you last time, so you know what NOT to do. We just need to figure out what TO do and this thing is toast."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_return_04"		"Okay, we can do this. Let's focus, focus is number one. Dont look it in the eyes. That's two. Dont turn your back on him. Dont run. Turn your back to him if you have to. And act... casual. Just be cool. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_pb_intro_return_05"		"Okay, new plan! We're still going to fight this wretched evil, just like last time. But this time -- and here's where we change things up -- we win! There's an Aghanim at stake!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_primal_beast_tease_01"		"Ooh hmm. Not trying to alarm you here -- don't panic -- but using the Continuum Device might -- I want to stress might -- have awoken a primal force of ancient evil. So just a heads up on that. If you see one, that's what it is."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_primal_beast_tease_02"		"Eesh. Did you hear that? You're looking like you heard that. Darn. OK, so hey,  I was poking through the instructions on the Continuum Device, and I skimmed over something about a primal force of ancient evil, anyway, blah blah blah, lots of legalese, but if you see a big, primal beast let me know."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_primal_beast_tease_03"		"Did you hear that? Do you see any primal forces of ancient evil down there? No? Okay, good. Because apparently screwing around with the Continuum Device woke one up. So you might have to fight one. You also might not! Look on the bright side, that's my motto."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_primal_beast_tease_04"		"OK... hold on. I'm reading the small print on the Continuum Device manual. You MIGHT have to fight a primal beast. No, wait, I was reading the runes upside down. You WON'T have to fight it, it's going to help you! Excellent, I -- no, they were rightside up, apologies, you WILL have to fight it."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_primal_beast_add_on_01"		"You're probably wondering if that unkillable Primal Beast is still prowling the depths of the Continuum Vault, hungry only for flesh and bone. (long beat) I mean, I'd be really worried about that if I was in your shoes."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_primal_beast_add_on_02"		"Oh-oh-oh-oh... JUST got handwritten word here, that primal beast? The ancient evil one? GONE! Oh, wait, more on the backside... gone... absolutely insane. Oh. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_primal_beast_add_on_03"		"You know, I was thinking, really glad to have you four helping me out BUT it might have been just QUICKER for me to have recruited the Primal Beast himself. He seems super good at killing stuff and might just hand over the Aghanims once we build a rapport. Oh well, that's the way it goes."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_primal_beast_add_on_04"		"Remember heros! The primal force of ancient evil still lurks in the Continuum Vault! I don't think there's any chance you've forgotten that, I just like saying PRIMAL FORCE OF ANCIENT EVIL."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_primal_beast_add_on_05"		"WHAT IF instead of fighting the Primal Beast and immediately dying you guys asked him to join your crew, you know? I bet he never even gets asked."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_01"		"By the Cauldron of Mephistopheles, you did it! You made the primal force of ancient evil give up! You drank deep from the Springs of Valor, reforged the Breastplate of Bravery at the Fjords of Fearlessness, and planted your Boots of Planting right up his ass. Ha HA!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_02"		"Did the primal force of ancient evil just run AWAY? Ha HA! Maybe hes gone off to find his primal ancient typewriter so he can write you a strongly worded letter! About how you kicked his ass!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_03"		"You stopped the primal force of unstoppable evil! He ran away! Hell deny it later, but I totally saw it! He totally stopped wanting to fight you! He was just like, No thanks! That is SO embarrassing for him. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_04"		"Huzzah! You killed - well, chased off and gravely embarrassed - the primal beast! Now comes the bittersweet breaking of our fellowship. Aghanim the wizard You the guy.. The sword guy The rest of you Aghanim had a lot of plates spinning magically in the ether and didnt have time to learn everyones name."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_05"		"Man, what a fight! I was on the edge of my magical seat for that one. I thought for sure the primal beast had you back there, when that one hero screwed up. I mean, you know who you are. We ALL know who you are, we all definitely saw it. You wow, what a screwup. Anyway, congratulations to the rest of you, good stuff."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_06"		"Good work, everybody! You should all be very proud of yourselves. I know I'm proud of MY self, I did a lot of work to make this happen! So be proud of whatever it was you were also doing to make this happen!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_04_half1"		"Huzzah! You killed - well, chased off and gravely embarrassed - the primal beast!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_04_half2"		"But now comes the bittersweet breaking of our fellowship. Aghanim the wizard You the guy.. The sword guy The rest of you Aghanim had a lot of plates spinning magically in the ether and didnt have time to learn everyones name."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_05_half1"		"Man, what a fight! I was on the edge of my magical seat for that one."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_primal_beast_05_half2"		"I thought for sure the primal beast had you back there, when that one hero screwed up. I mean, you know who you are. We ALL know who you are, we all definitely saw it. You wow, what a screwup. Anyway, congratulations to the rest of you, good stuff."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_pb_last_01"		"Wow! You just beat Primal Beast on the Hardest Difficulty Setting! You beat him so bad you broke the fourth wall! Hi, this is Rich Sommer, voice of Aghanim the Sorcerer. Very impressive. Alright, I need to get back in character now. [acting voice] Wizard. Mighty wizard. I am a powerful and mighty ice-spear-throwing wizard."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_win_pb_last_02"		"Wow! You've done it! I-- I'm shocked. I didn't expect this. You know, I'm just going to read you the speech I had prepared for when you all died at the cusp of an impossible victory. Ahem. Lo, these mere mortals, these four courageous heroes, all died doing what they loved. Looking at someone they loved. Me, Aghanim the All-Lovable, looking down upon them. As they die. The last words on their lips, We're glad you survived, Aghanim. You were the best of us. You...-- well, it goes on, but that's the part whe"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_01"		"Let me tell you what a Continuum Device is. Capable of bending space and time, the Continuum Device yields unto its owner unlimited power to shape infinite realities. Thats from the owners manual. Ships with an exclusive nylon draw-string pouch. A piece unique, one of one, pouch machine washable. Device does NOT immediately destroy the universe.That's from the box."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_02"		"There is A LOT of helpful stuff in this owners manual -- how to turn the Continuum Device on, how to alter spacetime properly, how to avoid filling your reality with inferior versions of yourself from backwater alternate dimensions. I REALLY wish Id read this thing before I started pushing all the buttons."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_03"		"Before you go and get all judgy about Aghanim the All-Powerful attempting to eek out a little MORE power by mucking around with the Continuum Device, remember that a modern society and all of its charms was brought to you by someone trying to eek out JUST a little more power. Capitalism makes hypocrites of us all."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_04"		"According to the manual, what have been wrought, once wrought, cannot be unwrought. Possibly. I havent gotten to the Troubleshooting part of the manual yet. Tell you what, I'll keep reading the manual. Why dont you heroes make yourselves useful and go round up all the other parallel universe mes?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_05"		"They put a lot of fancy promotional language on the Continuum Device packaging. What it DOESN'T say is what's inside is as fragile as a hummingbirds egg. So, in your rush to get it out of the box and start altering space and time, if you happen to press ANY of its myriad buttons just a LITTLE too hard, its going to go haywire and start filling your reality with inferior versions of yourself from far-flung realities. EACH OF WHICH diminishes your power exponentially, simply by existing. Is that a lot of c"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_06"		"Theres something you should know about these OTHER Aghanims. Theyre not like your close, personal friend THE Aghanim. They are from far-flung reaches of the most outre parallel realities. There is no telling what is normal where they come from. What Im trying to say is that theyre going to be weird. But they still have feelings. Unless theyre from a no-feeling having reality. Then feel free to stare, call them whatever you want, its no big deal."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_07"		"Also, the alternate reality mes may be guarded by terrifying monsters. You might be asking why. Good question, nice hustle. There's two things you should know about Aghanim. One, whatever the dimension, Aghanim likes the action on basketball games at Dark Elf casinos. And two, he is not good at it. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_08"		"You might be wondering what I'm doing with all these Aghanims after you rescue them. Well, I'll tell you, they're -- all going to a wizard farm. Up north. They're frolicking and -- eating lettuce. It's -- it's nice. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_09"		"We -- you and I -- have a relationship built on trust. So you need to trust that, when we rescue one of these Aghanims, I'm going to try to get them back to their home reality. I'm going to try really hard. And you have to trust that I have. I'm trusting you to trust me. It's the trust that's key, not so much where these guys actually end up."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_10"		"[stage whisper, cupping phone] Hold on, I'm on hold with Customer Service. [big, to rep] What's that? Yes, you idiot, of COURSE I pressed the green button. What's that? Exactly. Of COURSE I didn't press the green button. That would release countless interdimensional versions of me into the spacetime continuum and void the warranty. That's why I didn't press the green button, because I read the manual."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_11"		"[stage whisper, cupping phone] Still on hold with Customer Serv-- hold on -- [big, to rep] What's that? No, I have some heroes in there now. I can't get them out, they're -- well, of course it's deadly, that's why they're heroes! I -- what's that? Really? Uh huh. Uh huh. You're kidding. Oh God."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_12"		"Looking through the Troubleshooting section of the Continuum Device manual. I'm hoping I can just reboot this thing. Annnnnd.... there. Did reality just start and restart? Did anyone's hair turn white and they can't stop screaming? If someone's white-haired and screaming that means it worked."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_13"		"Alright. You deserve to know the truth. The alternate universe Aghanims you're rescuing... I'm killing them. Re-absorbing their energy. Out of their eye sockets. Excruciatingly painful, they're dessicated husks when I'm done. I do sell the husks to a wizard farm up north, that part I wasn't lying about. They make pig slurry out of them."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_14"		"I kept it a secret what I was doing to the alternate universe mes because I knew you'd be devastated. Just the idea of killing an Aghanim -- it's a tragedy. One Aghanim is like a hundred thousand regular people, so slurping their brain energy out of their skulls isn't something I do lightly."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_room_success_exposition_15"		"Aghanim wants you to consider this: Imagine the force of wizardry it must take to open a portal to another dimension and THEN quickly -- and safely -- transport someone through it. Now, recall that the entire reason youre helping me here is because Aghanims powers remain diminished. Ergo, it doesnt quite make sense that Id be able to return these other Aghanims to their home realities in my current state, given the wizarding horse-power needed to complete the task. Leaving poor Aghanim no other choice "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_intro_first_c"		"I know you see me as Aghanim the all-powerful, so this really hurts to pull back the curtain, but with these other back-water Aghanims farting around our reality I feel as if I'm a fraction of my former self. A SHADOW of my former self! A fraction of a shadow! Im a pile of magic garbage! I dont like you to see me like this. Alas: I am incapable of rescuing them from the Continuum Vault myself."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_01"		"Alas, there is ONE last order of business."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_02a"		"But wait! There's more!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_02b"		"But wait! There's more!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_03"		"Now, where is that awful copy of me?"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_04"		"But more importantly, my powers."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_rescue_rejoinder_05"		"Wait wait -- lest we forget why we're all here!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_broentrance_01"		"Brah... feeling rad... let's go do magic."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_broentrance_02"		"Oof, look at this one. Real pick of the alternate reality litter we have here. Let's go. This way. Away."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_mechentrance_02"		"Look at him. Full of prime Aghanim power. Hrrrng... AGHANIMS! You can't live with them, can't just kill 'em and reabsorb your power. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_goatentrance_02"		"Ah, look, the most powerful wizard from a barnyard reality. Watch as it sops up all of my magical gravy with its disgusting cud. (self) Well, he'll be thrilled with where he's going. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_donkeyentrance_02"		"Are you shi-- OK-- really? All of that, these heroes, fought SO hard, for this?! My powers currently residing somewhere beneath a pile of flies and excrement? Glorious. "
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_bucketentrance_02"		"Gasp! Sweet bucket of Aghanim, brought here from a reality without SKELETONS! My, what irony. Slosh this way and we'll sort you right out."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_event_room_intro_03"		"Hey, check out this guy."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_roshentrance_02"		"Ah! My powers reside within this small Roshan. That's not so bad! I'm not as offended by this as I might be otherwise! I take spend literal minutes trying to get you home safely! Maybe! Maybe not!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_tinker_01"		"This guy looks like he has a lot of hobbies and I don't really trust people who have lots of hobbies. It's weird."
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_session_intro_04"		"Well, look who it is!"
		"announcer_aghanim_agh_allaghs_01"		"Ahhh, I did it! I feel SO much better! I SURGE with power! My robes FLOW with wonder! I can hang up on TECH SUPPORT who has had me on hold for over six HUNDRED hours! Until we meet again, heroes!"
